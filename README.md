# ML-Study-PCA
Explore ice break up dates for lakes over a small region with similar environmental conditions:     
    - Use Screeplot to see ho many PCs are required to explain a sufficient amount of the variability in lake ice break up.     
    - Use Scattermatrix to see relationship between PCs and latitude, longitude of coordinates of lakes.     
    - Reconstruct lake break up dates with necessary PCs, visualizing predict dates and true dates with line plot to see difference.
